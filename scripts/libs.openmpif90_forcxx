# This script obtains the Fortran OpenMPI libraries that need to be explicitly added to
# the link line when linking with a C++ linker. (This adds an extra instance of -lmpi, but
# that shouldn't be a problem.)
OPENMPI_MPIF90=`which $1`
libs=`${OPENMPI_MPIF90} --showme:libs`
# The above returns the names of the libraries without '-l'. Here we add '-l' to the start
# of each library name:
echo $libs | sed -E 's/(^| ) */ -l/g'
